<P>Like my <a href="books.html">list of books</a>, this is a list
of movies I've seen since I started keeping track (March 2010). This
is basically to augment my own memory. I'm only writing down movies I actually
made some effort to see, and that I watched the whole way through. So
whatever random comedy I happen to be watching on TBS on any given Saturday
will probably not make the list. IMDB references are included for
your convenience. Oh, and I guess it's fair to say there might be
some <b>spoilers</b> in there, although I'll try my best not to ruin
any movie that shouldn't be ruined...

<ul>
  <li><a name="paris36"><strong><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0948535/">Paris
  36</a></strong></a> This movie was really fun! It's a musical/drama.
  I recognized the main character from the movie, The Chorus.

  <li><a name="policeadj"><strong><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1337051/">Police,
  Adjective</a></strong></a> Wow, this movie was slow. I was expecting
  way more witty dialog from the trailer. I probably would not
  recommend it.

  <li><a name="inglourious"><strong><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0361748/">Inglourious Basterds</a></strong></a> A very entertaining movie. I loved
  the fact that it was mostly in French and German. Worth seeing. It is
  violent, but probably less so than Tarantino's other movies. I was
  happy to recognize two German actors that I had recently seen. One was
  Alex, from <a href="#goodbyelenin">Goodbye Lenin</a> and the other was
  the SS doctor from <a href="#downfall">Downfall.</a>

  <li><a name="whiteribbon"><strong><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1149362/">The
  White Ribbon</a></strong></a>This movie wasn't as good as I was
  expecting, but the actor who plays the teacher does a really good
  job.

  <li><a name="downfall"><strong><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0363163/">Downfall</a></strong></a> This movie is great. Very well acted. It's about
  the last days in Hitler's bunker, and while it's pretty grim, as you
  can imagine, it's definitely worth seeing.

  <li><a name="funnypeople"><strong><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1201167/">Funny People</strong></a> Watched this on plane ride back from Berlin. Definitely
  enjoyable, not sure why it was considered a bust. Well, I guess not
  enough people saw it. Like any Apataw movie, it's got oscenity,
  serious moments, and some really funny jokes.

  <li><a name="goodbyelenin"><strong><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0301357/">Goodbye,
  Lenin!</a></strong></a> Funny movie. I enjoyed it.
