<P>Here you may find ramblings of all sorts on food and all things related.
Since everyone from New Orleans, deep down, wants to be a chef more than
anything else, I like to pretend that I know how to cook!</P>

<strong>Easy Recepie Collection</strong> This is my slowly expanding list of
recepies that are both easy to make and still taste better than most of the
crap we'd otherwise be eating. The criteria is as follows: Recepies should be
easy, skill-wise, should require relatively few ingredients and should take
a reasonable amount of time to make. (The goal I am shooting for is something
you can make quickly enough after you get home that you won't be starving by
the time it's ready! I'm currently shooting at ~30 minutes or less.) Finally,
everything I have posted here I have made myself, preferable a few times so
I can be sure it's really worth doing. Awesome.
<ul>
<li><a href="food/pepper_steak.xml">Pepper Steak</a>
(<a href="food/pepper_steak_un.xml">Unformatted XML</a>) This is another tasty
one that could basically be described as "close to stir-fry." Maybe the
italian version of stir-fry? Anyway, this means that it's quick to fix,
has vegitables, uses inexpensive meat, and tastes best over rice. Plus it's
colorful, which is nice.
<ul>
<li><strong>Time:</strong> 25 minutes total
<li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Easy
</ul>

</ul>

<ul>
<li><a href="food/lentil_soup.xml">Lentil Soup</a> 
(<a href="food/lentil_soup_un.xml">Unformatted XML</a>) 
I make this all the live-long.
It's surprisingly easy to do and surprisingly filling. Plus if you or yours is 
a vegitarian, you can just take out the sausage and it still works. You can
do it all in one pot. 
<ul>
<li><strong>Time:</strong> 25-30 minutes total
<li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Easy
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><a href="food/crawfish_etoufee.xml">Crawfish Etoufee</a> 
(<a href="food/crawfish_etoufee_un.xml">Unformatted XML</a>) Yes, I do realize
that this has a number of ingredients, whereas I usually try to keep the total
number of ingredients low. BUT, they are almost all simple ones. This is
crawfish etouffee (there should be a right-facing accent on the second 'e') an
excellent creole dish if made by the right person, but apparently not too hard
to make yourself. I haven't actually made this myself yet, but the plan is to
do so in the immediate future. But I have had this recipe; my mom made is for
us all the time. The hardest part, it seems like, is going to be finding the
crawfish tails. They usually sell them in frozen or refridgerated packages just
like you might buy shrimp or scallops or something. I have a good feeling that
Whole Foods might even have them...
<ul>
<li><strong>Time:</strong> 30 minutes total
