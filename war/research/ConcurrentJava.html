<title>A List of Concurrent Java Programs</title>
</head>

<body>
<h2>Concurrent Java Programs and Benchmarks</h2>

<p>This page presents a (ideally) ever-growing list of concurrent, open-source
Java programs that I have found available on the Internet. The plan is to
classify them according to attributes that are both of general interest
(e.g., lines of source) and those that are specific to my own research interests.
It is my belief that this list should be helpful for those attempting to do
programming language reseach on concurrent, Java-like languages who are in need
of suitable examples and benchmarks.
</p>

<h3>Categories</h3>
<table style="width:30%;">
  <tr>
    <td>Toy</td><td>This program is (in my opinion) a toy example.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Emb!</td><td>This program is embarassingly parallel, requiring no
                     or little synchronization.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>States</td><td>This program has some state-machine style behavior</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Constructs</td><td>Synchronization constructs used. Includes <i>Syn</i> (synchronized), <i>WNJ</i> (wait/notify/join), <i>J5C</i> (Java5 Concurrency Libraries) and <i>Cust</i> (custom synchronization primitives).</td>

    <td>This is a much more realistic appliction than the others. Unfortunately, it
    was written as an assignment for a lab and is therefore incomplete, however
    making it run is really easy if you follow the directions on the lab page.
    This is a GUI application that runs over the network. Different threads
    exist to listen to the network and open up connections. I have found two
    race conditions in this program.

    <td>A simple applet that draws a plasma-like substance quickly. I'll try not
    to post too many applets here because their synchronization behavior is usually
    pretty similar, however this applet interestingly <i>waits</i> to generate
    new data until a draw has occurred, so it may be interesting for that reason.

    <td>A simple program with "web server-like" concurent behavior. Writer thread
        writes numbers to a hash table while readers remove them. A true
	producer/consumer example, except that get from the hash table could in
	theory insert a new element, although this should not happen here.
	Rewritten to use generics. Because the paper
	describes the removal of unncessary synchronization, most methods are
	synchronized.
