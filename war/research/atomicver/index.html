<h2>Verification of Object Protocols in Concurrent Programs</h2>

<p>
This page presents a collection of Java programs that have been
specified and/or verified using Plural/NIMBY. Full details of the tool
can be found in several locations, but the best starting point is the
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/pluralism/">Plural project page</a>
on Google Code. This includes the full source
for both Plural (single-threaded protocol verification) and NIMBY
(concurrent protocol verification), as well as links to various
papers. More importantly, that page is easier to update and is
connected to the SVN repository, so it is much more likely to be
up-to-date!
</p>

<h3>Programs from the OOPSLA '08 Paper</h3>

<p>
These are the programs described in the OOPSLA '08 paper,
<i>Verifying Correct Usage of Atomic Blocks and Typestate</i> by
N. Beckman, K. Bierhoff, and J. Aldrich. These programs are part
of the Plural/NIMBY test suite, and therefore should verify with
the current version of NIMBY at all times.

<table>
<tr style="font-weight:bold;">
<td>Example Name</td><td>Source</td><td>Notes</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="first">Chat</td>
<td class="filename">
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/pluralism/source/browse/trunk/PluralTestsAndExamples/src/edu/cmu/cs/nimby/test/oopsla/Chat.java">Chat.java</a>
</td>
<td>
The Chat example is used as a running example throughout the paper. The
main difference here is that we use Java annotation syntax as required
by the NIMBY tool.

<td class="first">JGroups JChannel</td>
<td class="filename">

<td>
These two files represent the specification of the JChannel class, an abstraction
of a network connection from the 
<a href="http://www.jgroups.org">JGroups</a> project, and the implementation
of one of the demos that is provided with JGroups. This demo, CausalDemo, makes
use of the the JChannel protocol.

</td>
<td>
Request Processor is a simple, toy program that was specified and verified to
illustrate that our approach could handle object invariants of mutable,
thread-shared objects.

</td>
<td>
Reservation manager was the original program that was going to be used
as a running example throughout the paper. It is still somewhat interesting,
but, frankly, not as realistic as the Chat program.

<h3>Other Case Studies</h3>

<p>
The following are a list of other programs that I have specified and/or
verified with Plural/NIMBY as part of my research.
</p>

<table>
<tr style="font-weight:bold;">
<td>Example Name</td><td>Source</td><td>Notes</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="first">Blocking Queue</td>
<td class="filename">
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/pluralism/source/browse/trunk/PluralTestsAndExamples/src/com/holub/asynch/Blocking_queue.java">Blocking_queue.java</a><br>
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/pluralism/source/browse/trunk/PluralTestsAndExamples/src/edu/cmu/cs/nimby/test/interesting/OneReaderOneWrtier.java">OneReaderOneWriter.java</a>
</td>
<td>This example is the full example that was presented in the OOPSLA 2008
talk on NIMBY. It's a thread-shared blocking queue. Note that the
blocking queue class was written by Allen I. Holub, and is used with
permission. Thanks! The verification of both the implementation side and
the client work. The client is in the OneReaderOneWriter file.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="first">Thread Shared and Back</td>
<td class="filename">
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/pluralism/source/browse/trunk/PluralTestsAndExamples/src/edu/cmu/cs/nimby/test/interesting/ThreadSharedAndBack.java">ThreadSharedAndBack.java</a>
</td>
<td>
In this example, we take an object that is thread local, share it between two
threads, and then reconstruct the unique, thread local permission. This is
a sort of litmis test for many concurrent analyses. Note that we are using the
parameter "capture" mechanism of PLURAL in order to ensure that the fraction
that comes back from the other thread is the same. We haven't completely verified
the implementation of the join method, but the fact that the join method
requires a full permission and does not return it should ensure that no
permissions could be duplicated.

</td>
<td>
A functional-style cons list with a very simple protocol: EMPTY or NONEMPTY. There
are also some interesting protocols in the two iterator methods, although they
have already been specified by Kevin in earlier work.
