<p><strong>Modular Typestate Checking for Concurrent Java
Programs</strong> My entry to
the <a href="http://www.oopsla.org/oopsla2009/cfp/due-july-02-2009/7-src">2009
OOPSLA Student Research Competition</a>. In this competition, undergraduate
and graduate student in computer science give a presentation of their
research which includes a written submission, a  poster, and finally a
short oral presentation. I was lucky enough to be selected the third place
winner, and for that I am quite excited. I have included my presentation
and my poster here.

<p><strong>jStar Presentation from Separation Logic</strong> In the
course, "Current Research in Separation Logic," taught by John
Reynolds, I presented a paper by Dino Distefano and Matthew Parkinson
on <a href="http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1449764.1449782">jStar</a>, an
automated separation logic prover for Java programs. Here are the
slides from that presentation.  <ul> <li><a

<p><strong>Arkan&#8734;id: Breaking Out of a Finite Space.</strong>
This talk was a presentation of my work given at
<a href="http://www.sigbovik.org/2009/">SIGBOVIK 2009</a>. I presented
on a paper of the same name. It describes an infinite brick-breaking
game that you should download from my <a href="software.html">software
page</a>.

<p><strong>Verifying the Correct Usage of Atomic Blocks and Typestate</strong>
This talk was a presentation of my work given at
<a href="http://www.oopsla.org/oopsla2008/">OOPSLA 2008</a>. It was the
presentation of our paper of the same name, which can be found on my
<a href="/publications.html">publications
page</a>. It describes how we use access permissions, an alias control
technology similar to ownership or separation logic, to verify the
correct usage of object protocols in concurrent OO programs.

<P><strong>Unit Testing: Philosophy and Tools</strong>
This presentation was given on February 1st, 2007 as a lecture in
a course at CMU
entitled, <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aldrich/courses/654/">
Analysis of Software Systems</a> taught by Jonathan
Aldrich. It discusses unit testing, when and why to use it,
the JUnit framework and EasyMock, a mock objects framework.

<P><strong>Failure Handling in a Modal Language</strong>
A presentation given on the current state of my research, as of
October 30, 2006. I am attempting to add some failure-handling

<P><strong>A Survey of Race Detection Techniques</strong> 
In the course <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aldrich/courses/654/">
Analysis of Software Artifacts</a> which I took in
the spring of 2006, my final project was a litterature survery which compared
different analysis techniques, static and dynamic, on their abilities to
find one particular defect: data races. This is the presentation of that
work. This was a talk of approximately 50 minutes, used to lecutre to a
group of masters and PhD students. The full paper text can be located
<a href="/papers/race_detection_survey.pdf">

<P><strong>The Claytronics Project and DSLs</strong> These are the slides from
my second SSSG talk, and I'm starting to understand how these things work. 
They cover background on the Claytronics project. They also go into some
detail on my experiences programing catoms for the Claytronics project using
C++ and some things that we might like to improve about the entire experience.

<P><strong>Component Markets and COTS-Based Development</strong> These slides
come from my lecture on COTS-based software development in the software 
engineering course entitled

"Methods: What to Design and Why"</a>.
It was given as part of the "Business" unit of the course, and includes my
own notes on the lecture and on the research that I performed for this topic.
