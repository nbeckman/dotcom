SIFT: System Design and Implementation. Charles B. Weinstock, SRI International.
</TD><TD>
SIFT stands for Software Implemented Fault-Tolerance. SIFT is an operating system created for avionics
systems that runs some kind of middle-ware to provide important, fault tolerance services like data voting
and processor reconfiguration. The paper spends some time discussing how this reconfigurations works, how
the voting works, how clock synchronization works, etc.

This paper proposes that there is a step missing in most contemporary computer
science education; the step between the customer's needs and the initial
design of the software system. This paper proposes a class to address this
need and other. The class focuses on Methodologies that are more
applicable for today's software projects which often require the eliciting
of requirements from customers, prototypes, and involve frequently changing
and possibly distributed conditions. It tells us that as software engineers
we must take important business concerns like software value into
consideration.

</td>
<td>
In this paper, the authors propose a language, nesC, for embedded networked
systems. Specifically, the target platform for nesC are smart-dust systems
or sensor networks where lots of very small, weak computers are in an
environment and must work together. nesC is a domain language and it restrics
some of its capabilities, but it provides many necessary features like
concurrency and event-based processing. Restrictions include compile-time
analysis of locks for shared variables, in order to eliminate race conditions.
There is no dynamic memory. nesC also includes some elements of an ADL. It
includes two types of components, processing and configuration. Configuration
components act like an ADL in that they describe how processing components
are to be instantiated and connected.
