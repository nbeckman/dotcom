From 2005 until 2010 I was a Software Engineering PhD. student at <A 
href="http://www.cmu.edu">Carnegie Mellon University</a>. But now I have
graduated! The program is run
through the <a href="http://www.isri.cmu.edu/">Institute for Software Research</a>. My advisor was <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aldrich/">Dr. Jonathan Aldrich</a>.  
<br><br>
From 2001 until 2005 I was an undergraduate major in computer science 
at the <a href="http://www.usc.edu">University of Southern California</a>. 
I was also a research assistant under <a href="http://sunset.usc.edu/~neno/">
Nenad Medvidovic</a> in the <a href="http://csse.usc.edu">USC Center for 
Software Engineering</a>.
